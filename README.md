# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of the Foundations Course at The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to practice HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. The site will consist of a main index page which links to a few recipes.

## Project Overview
This project focuses purely on HTML and building fundamental web development skills. The website won't have elaborate styling as the main objective is to reinforce HTML basics. Styling will be revisited in future projects with CSS.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- Git and GitHub for version control and deployment
