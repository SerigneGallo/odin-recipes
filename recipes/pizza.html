  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Pizza Margherita showcases the quintessential flavors of Italy with its 
    simple, fresh ingredients. It features a base of tender dough topped with 
    vibrant tomato sauce, slices of fresh mozzarella, and whole basil leaves.</p>

 <p> A drizzle of olive oil is added before baking in a hot oven, creating a crispy, 
  charred crust with a gooey, melted cheese topping. The combination of tangy 
  tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and aromatic basil makes this pizza a timeless 
  favorite.</p> 
  
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>dough</strong>  - enough for one large pizza</li>
    <li><strong>sauce</strong>  - 1/2 cup, preferably made from San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh mozzarella cheese</strong> - 200 grams, sliced or torn into pieces</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh basil leaves</strong> - a handful</li>
    <li><strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong> - for drizzling</li>
    <li><strong>Salt</strong> - to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
      Set your oven to its highest temperature (450-500°F or 230-260°C). 
      If you have a pizza stone, place 
      it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
        If you're using store-bought or premade dough, let it come to 
        room temperature. This makes it easier to stretch without tearing.
        On a floured surface, gently stretch the dough into a round 
        shape using your hands or a rolling pin, aiming for even thickness.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Tomato Sauce:</strong>
          Spoon the tomato sauce onto the center of your stretched dough. 
          Using the back of the spoon, spread the sauce evenly, leaving a small 
          border around the edges for the crust.</li>
          <li><strong>Add the Cheese and Basil:</strong>
            Distribute slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.Scatter
            fresh basil leaves on top of the cheese. You can tear larger leaves
            to distribute the flavor more evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Drizzle with Olive Oil:</strong>
              Lightly drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the pizza. 
              This adds flavor and helps achieve a golden color.</li>
              <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
                Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza 
                stone if using). Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is 
                puffy and golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
                If your oven has a broiler, you can broil the pizza for the last 
                minute to get a more charred top.</li>
                <li><strong>Serving:</strong>
                  Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool 
                  for a few minutes. This allows the cheese to set slightly, 
                  making it easier to cut.
                  Slice and serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
