  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of pasta, 
  cheese, meat sauce, and béchamel. Begin by preparing a meat sauce 
  with ground beef, onions, garlic, and tomatoes, seasoned with herbs 
  and a splash of red wine. Simultaneously, make a béchamel sauce from butter, 
  flour, and milk, spiced with nutmeg.</p>

 <p>Assemble the lasagna by layering béchamel, noodles, more béchamel, meat sauce, 
  and a mixture of mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat these layers, 
  finishing with pasta and cheese on top. Bake until golden and let it rest before 
  serving to allow the flavors to meld.</p>
