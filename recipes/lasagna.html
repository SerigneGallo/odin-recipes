  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of pasta, 
  cheese, meat sauce, and béchamel. Begin by preparing a meat sauce 
  with ground beef, onions, garlic, and tomatoes, seasoned with herbs 
  and a splash of red wine. Simultaneously, make a béchamel sauce from butter, 
  flour, and milk, spiced with nutmeg.</p>

 <p>Assemble the lasagna by layering béchamel, noodles, more béchamel, meat sauce, 
  and a mixture of mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat these layers, 
  finishing with pasta and cheese on top. Bake until golden and let it rest before 
  serving to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Prep Ingredients:
      Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
      Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions (if not using no-boil noodles), 
      then drain and set aside.
      Grate and measure out your cheeses.</li>
      <li>Make the Meat Sauce:
        In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, 
        cooking until soft and translucent.
        Add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned.
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), oregano, basil, salt, 
        and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 20-30 minutes until thickened. Adjust seasoning 
        as needed.</li>
      <li>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:
        In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir until the mixture 
        becomes a light golden paste, creating a roux.
        Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook and stir 
        until the sauce thickens.
        Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Assemble the Lasagna:
        Spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.
        Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the béchamel.
        Add a layer of meat sauce over the noodles followed by dollops of ricotta 
        cheese and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
        Repeat the layers (béchamel, noodles, meat sauce, cheeses) until all ingredients are 
        used, finishing with a layer of noodles topped with béchamel and a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
      <li>Bake the Lasagna:
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent cheese from sticking, you can 
        lightly grease the foil).
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for 
        an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden.
        Let the lasagna sit for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the 
        layers set and makes serving easier.</li>
