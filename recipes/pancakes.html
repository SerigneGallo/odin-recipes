  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Pancakes are a popular breakfast treat known for their fluffy texture and 
    golden exterior. The basic pancake batter consists of flour, baking powder, 
    sugar, salt, milk, an egg, and melted butter. The ingredients are mixed until 
    smooth, with the baking powder acting as a leavening agent to give the pancakes 
    their signature rise. To cook, the batter is poured in small amounts onto a hot, 
    lightly greased skillet.</p>

 <p>Each pancake is flipped once bubbles form on the surface 
  and the edges look set, ensuring both sides are evenly cooked to a light golden 
  brown. Pancakes are typically served warm with a variety of toppings such as maple
   syrup, fresh fruits, or a dollop of whipped cream, making them a versatile and
   beloved dish for both 
  everyday breakfasts and special occasions.</p> 
  
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour - 1 cup</li>
    <li>Sugar - 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Baking powder - 2 teaspoons</li>
    <li>Salt - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
    <li>Milk - 1 cup</li>
    <li>Egg - 1 large</li>
    <li>Melted butter - 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract (optional) - 1 teaspoon</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Batter:
      In a large mixing bowl, sift together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. This helps combine the dry ingredients evenly and makes the pancakes fluffier.
      In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of milk, 1 large egg, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract if using for extra flavor.
      Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir together until just combined. It's important not to overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
      <li>Heat the Pan:
        Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease it with butter or cooking oil. The pan is ready when a drop of water sizzles upon contact.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pancakes:
          For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to look set, about 1-2 minutes.
          Flip the pancake carefully with a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown.
          Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil to the pan as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
          <li>Serve Warm:
            Serve the pancakes hot off the griddle with your favorite toppings. Popular choices include maple syrup, honey, fresh fruits, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</li>
