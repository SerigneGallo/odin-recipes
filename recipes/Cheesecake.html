  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>A citrus cheesecake featuring a crisp shortbread crust requires considerable 
    preparation time, but the outcome is truly rewarding. If vanilla beans are 
    unavailable, you can use 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract as a substitute 
    for each inch of bean required. </p>

  <p> This cheesecake can be adorned with your 
  preferred fruits or toppings, or enjoyed simply as it is. Fresh fruits are 
  delightful during the summer, while chocolate 
  aficionados may prefer to enhance it with a layer of fudge topping.</p> 
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
    <li>½ vanilla bean</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
    <li>½ vanilla bean</li>
    <li>5 eggs</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon peel, and 1 teaspoon orange peel. Split a 1-inch piece of vanilla bean; scrape seeds into flour mixture. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add 1 egg yolk; stir until all flour is moistened. Gather dough into a ball, wrap in wax paper, and refrigerate for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Lightly butter a 9 inch springform pan. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch thick; trim to a 10 inch circle. Reserve pastry trimmings. Press pastry circle into the bottom and 1/2 inch up the sides of a 9 inch buttered springform pan. Refrigerate 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake crust for 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
      <li>Beat cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel, and 1 1/2 teaspoons orange peel in a large mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Split a 1-inch piece of vanilla bean and scrape seeds into the cream cheese mixture. Beat in 5 eggs and 2 egg yolks, one at a time, on medium speed. Stir in cream.</li>
      <li>Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roll out reserved pastry trimmings on a lightly floured board; cut into strips 2 inches wide. Pat strips up the side of the pan, pressing dough lightly to the baked crust. Pour filling into crust. Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR! Bake until cheesecake is firm in the center, about 50 minutes. Turn off oven; leave cheesecake in the oven with the door slightly open for 1 hour. Remove from oven, and cool completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.</li>
