  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    <li>¼ cup brewed espresso or strong coffee</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Pressurized whipped cream</li>
    <li>Caramel ice cream topping</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>

    <li><strong>Prepare the crust:</strong> Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons of sugar until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes, then remove and cool on a wire rack.</li>

    <li><strong>Adjust oven temperature:</strong> Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

    <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually add 1 cup of sugar, beating until blended. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in sour cream, espresso, and vanilla extract. Pour the batter into the baked and cooled crust.</li>

    <li><strong>Bake the cheesecake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 5 minutes; then turn the oven off, partially open the door and let the cheesecake rest inside for 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven, and carefully run a knife around the edges. Allow the cheesecake to cool on a wire rack to room temperature, then cover the springform pan with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours.</li>

    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> To serve, cut the cheesecake into wedges and garnish each slice with whipped cream and caramel sauce.</li>
