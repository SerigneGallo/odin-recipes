  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Apple cheesecake blends the creamy texture of cheesecake with 
    sweet, tangy apples. It features a buttery crust, usually
    made from crushed graham crackers, and a smooth filling of 
    cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla. </p>

  <p>Spiced apple slices, sautéed 
    in cinnamon and nutmeg, are either layered or mixed into the filling. 
    Once baked and cooled, it's often topped with powdered sugar, additional 
    apple slices, or caramel sauce, 
    creating a perfect treat for fall or special occasions.</p> 
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <strong>Crust:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>½ cup finely chopped pecans</li>
    <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<strong>Filling:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<strong>Topping:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped pecans</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

    <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Combine graham cracker crumbs, pecans, melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl until well mixed. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven but keep the oven on.</li>

    <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract. Pour this filling over the baked crust.</li>

    <li><strong>Make the topping:</strong> Place the apples in a bowl. In a smaller bowl, mix sugar and cinnamon together; then pour this mixture over the apples and toss to coat. Spoon the sugared apples over the filling and sprinkle pecans on top.</li>

    <li><strong>Final baking and cooling:</strong> Bake in the oven until the edges of the cheesecake are puffed, about 60 to 70 minutes. Carefully run the tip of a table knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cheesecake, then place the pan on a wire rack to cool at room temperature for about 1 hour. Refrigerate the cheesecake until it is completely chilled, which will take 4 hours to overnight.</li>
